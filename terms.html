Our Services consist of providing access to virtual document storage space for the Subscriber to facilitate the editing of documents through a user interface (“Editor”) and the retrieval of those same documents through an application programming interface (<strong>“API”</strong>). You may use this Service to edit documents for your own end-customers (<strong>“End-Customers”</strong>). However, Livingdocs assumes no responsibility for your document editing (the edited content of the Subscriber’s document) and/or the delivery of these documents to the Subscriber’s End-Customers.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            By accepting this Agreement, the Subscriber accepts the Agreement to establish a binding contractual relationship between Subscriber and Livingdocs (each a <strong>“Party”</strong>, together the “Parties”) for the use of the Services.

In this case, the Subscriber will be informed in advance by adequate means (e-mail considered sufficient) with a request to accept the new terms via Link. Should Livingdocs not receive an answer from the Subscriber within four (4) weeks starting from the announcement of change by Livingdocs and should Subscriber continue to use the Services, this will be deemed an acceptance of the changed terms.</li>
            <li>Livingdocs does not offer maintenance or support services to Subscribers. However, it may offer them on a discretionary basis as a gesture of goodwill. However, Subscribers may enter into an additional service level agreement with Livingdocs under separate terms and conditions. Furthermore, Subscribers may seek support through public community report platforms where Subscribers can submit their issues online and issues can be resolved by comments received from community support (or on a discretionary basis by our staff). Should You decide to implement solutions obtained from community support, You are doing this at your own risk and Livingdocs is not liable for any damages caused by the implementation of any community support solutions.</li>

            <li>
              Subscriber is obliged to register with a valid e-mail address. By signing up Subscriber accepts that his e-mail address may be used for Service-related and marketing-related e-mail-notifications.

            <li>
              When subscribing, accessing or using the Services, Subscriber may not use bots, robots or similar automated tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Subscriber is solely responsible for the confidentiality and safekeeping of his credentials (in particular passwords, device administration and/or other credential storage settings).

Livingdocs assumes no liability for any damages caused by Subscriber’s failure to comply with the obligations in this section.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Subscriber shall defend, indemnify and hold Livingdocs harmless against any claims, damages or other amounts (including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs) alleged, asserted by or awarded to a third party arising from (i) Subscriber’s unlawful use of the Services or (ii) Subscriber’s breach of any provisions of this Agreement, in particular alleged or claimed infringements of third party rights or content deemed offensive. Upon Livingdoc’s first request, Subscriber shall participate in the legal dispute to the extent that this is permitted under the relevant rules of procedure. Subscriber undertakes to bear all the costs (including compensation payments) incurred by Livingdocs as a result of the court proceedings and/or any out of court settlement of the legal dispute.
